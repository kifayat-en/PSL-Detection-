# PSL-Detection-
Developed a Pakistan Sign Language detection system for Urdu alphabet recognition using Google's Teachable Machine to help deaf community communicate effectively. Implemented real-time computer vision to capture and classify Urdu alphabet hand gestures with high accuracy through webcam input. Created an educational AI tool that     bridges the communication gap by translating Urdu sign language gestures into digital text format. 
<h2>Pakistan Sign Language Detection using Google Teachable Machine</h2>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
This project aims to build a Pakistan Sign Language (PSL) detection model using Google Teachable Machine, a no-code machine learning platform. The model is trained on a custom dataset of PSL hand signs to recognize and classify different gestures. Unlike traditional deep learning methods where CNN architectures or pretrained models are coded manually, this project leverages transfer learning with MobileNet via TensorFlow.js inside Teachable Machine. The model achieves high accuracy and can be deployed in web or mobile applications, making it accessible and easy to use.

<h3>Result</h3>
- Achieved high training and validation accuracy on PSL dataset.<br>
- Model successfully recognizes PSL signs in real-time using a webcam.<br>
- Lightweight model (few MB) â†’ suitable for mobile/web apps.<br>

<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
- Google Teachable Machine<br>
- TensorFlow.js<br>
- MobileNet (Transfer Learning)<br>
- Web Browser (for training)<br>
